[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findopencv2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "opencv2", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "opencv2" with any
  of the following names:

    opencv2Config.cmake
    opencv2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "opencv2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "opencv2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "opencv2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
