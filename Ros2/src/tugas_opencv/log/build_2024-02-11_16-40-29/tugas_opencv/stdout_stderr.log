[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findopencv.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "opencv", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "opencv" with any
  of the following names:

    opencvConfig.cmake
    opencv-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "opencv" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "opencv_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "opencv"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
